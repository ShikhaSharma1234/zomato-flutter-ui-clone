# Zomato Flutter UI Clone

This is a user interface clone of the Zomato mobile app's homepage, built entirely with Flutter. The goal of this project was to practice building complex UIs and replicating the look and feel of a popular, real-world application.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Homepage Replication:** The layout of the main Zomato homepage is fully replicated.
* **Scrolling Lists:** Implements the vertical scrolling list of restaurants and horizontal scrolling categories.
* **Styling:** Matches the color scheme, fonts, and styling of the original application's UI.

## üõ†Ô∏è How I Built It

This project was an exercise in learning and practicing Flutter UI development. My process involved using generative AI for rapid code generation and scaffolding, followed by manual customization and debugging to achieve the final, pixel-perfect design.
